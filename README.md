Project Name : # Africa Disease Outbreak Analysis Dashboard

**Health Sector Insights Across African Regions**  
Data Analysis & Visualization Project

## Project Overview

Comprehensive exploratory data analysis and dashboard visualization of **disease outbreaks across Africa**, focusing on regional patterns, top diseases, patient outcomes, mortality/recovery rates, and demographic vulnerabilities.

Despite challenges with data sourcing (health data protection policies) and dataset inconsistencies, rigorous cleaning in **Excel + Python** enabled meaningful insights.

## Key Questions Explored

- Which region has the highest number of outbreaks?
- Which countries are the major hotspots?
- Which disease affects the most patients?
- What are the recovery & mortality rates?
- Which disease shows the best recovery performance?
- Which age group is most vulnerable?

## Major Findings & Insights

### Regional & Country Hotspots
Eastern Africa records the **highest outbreak volume**, followed by Northern and Western regions.

**Top 5 Countries by Outbreaks:**
- Morocco (North) → 2,591
- Ghana (West) → 2,526
- Uganda (East) → 2,519
- Kenya (East) → 2,511
- Egypt (North) → 2,483

Here are some representative visualizations of disease distribution and risk across African regions:

### Dominant Disease: Malaria
**Malaria** is by far the most prevalent disease with **over 3,000+ cases** recorded — yet it also shows the **highest recovery rate**.

This highlights the effectiveness of current malaria treatment and care programs across the continent.

Example dashboard-style view of malaria-related metrics:

### Patient Outcomes
- **High overall recovery rate** across Africa
- Majority of admitted patients still under treatment
- Deaths remain relatively low (<300 recorded)

### Most Vulnerable Age Group
The **65+ age group** shows the highest hospital admission rate — indicating significant vulnerability among the elderly.

Followed by the 36–50 age group.

## Executive Summary & Recommendations

- **Prioritize mortality risk**, not just case volume → West & North Africa need urgent attention despite lower total cases than East Africa.
- **Scale successful malaria frameworks** to other diseases for fast impact.
- **Target elderly populations** (65+) with specialized geriatric care, screenings, and preventive programs.
- Use **rate-based metrics** (e.g. mortality %) instead of raw counts for better resource planning.
- Continue strengthening **community education, early access to treatment, and mobile health services**.

**The real value lies not in where diseases are most common — but where they are most dangerous.**

## Tools & Technologies

- **Data Cleaning & Exploration** → Excel + Python (Pandas, etc.)
- **Visualization** → (Power BI / Tableau / Python libraries )
